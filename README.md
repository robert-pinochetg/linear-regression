# About the project

A simple project while iÂ´m studying linear regression analysis with the auto-mpg dataset from kaggle (a toy dataset). 

About MPG AUTO Dataset: The Auto MPG dataset contains information about cars from the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the goal of predicting fuel efficiency (MPG). It includes features like cylinders, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year. It's commonly used for regression tasks and learning data analysis techniques.

Project Structure: 
 - It is structured on 2 folders:
    1. 01-datasets: where all the datasets used are. 
    2. 02-notebooks: where all the notebooks for the analysis are.
         - Exploratory Data Analysis in order to identify patters and relationships previous the model. 
         - Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using statsmodels library in order to validate the assumptions, before the predictive model. 
         - Predictive Multiple Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
